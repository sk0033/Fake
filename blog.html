<p>When it comes to fitness, a common question is whether cardio or strength training is better. Both have their own benefits:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cardio Exercises (such as running, cycling, swimming) strengthen the heart and aid in weight loss.</li>
    <li>Strength Training (such as weightlifting, bodyweight exercises) builds muscle strength and boosts metabolism.</li>
</ul>
<p>A combination of both cardio and strength training is the best approach for overall fitness. It not only provides complete benefits to the body but also helps in staying fit and active in the long run.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> To adopt a healthy lifestyle, it is essential to follow a balanced diet, engage in regular exercise, and maintain a proper routine. Start with small steps and gradually make fitness a part of your daily life. Fitness is not just a physical process; it also makes you stronger mentally and emotionally.
